## Implemented Nodes

- german-holidays Node -get german holidays on any input

## How to use

### Configuration posibilities

![configuration of the node](images/node-german-holidays-properties.png?raw=true)

the region specifies the region for calculating the german holidays. If all is selected, all holidays are used (independend if they are really for all regions are available) and id "allgemeine" are used obnly holidays will be considered which are available in all regions of germany.

### Options for the incomming message object

The incomming messsage is mainly used for triogger the calculation. This will be done typically once per day. Nevertheless you have the following posibilitys to configure the working of the node by the following properties of the incomming messages:

- **region**, `msg.region` the region which should be used for getting holidays. Could also be defined in the configuration of the node. This property must be a string of two letters with the german state shortcut (BY=Bayern, BE=Berlin, ...).
- **ts**, `msg.ts` defines a timestamp for the source (today) for calculation of the data. if not defined today will be used.
- **day**, `msg.day` if defined only the Holiday information will get the relative to the timestamp (today by default). So if `msg.ts` is not defined, `msg.day = 0` is today, `msg.day = -1` is yesterday; `msg.day = 1` is tomorow, ... Additionally the output will be a day object **only** representing this day.
- **date**, `msg.date` if defined only the Holiday information for the defined date will given. If this is given, the output will be **only** a day object representing this day.

- `msg.payload.yesterday` _day-object_ day-object for the day before today.
- `msg.payload.today` _day-object_ day-object for today.
- `msg.payload.tomorrow` _day-object_ day-object for the day after today.

## Usage

Typically the node will be triggered at once every day and the result will be persistent in a global context. Then with a switch node the flows cann be conteolled by the usage of the properties of the object output.
Examples for using this node:

- shutter can be opened/closed on different timestamps based if today or tomorow is a holiday
- dimmer can set to different brightness based if it is a Holiday
